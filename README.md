CasualKrypt is an 'ongoing' pet project that started back in 2010. Although it started on Python, the latest iteration is in C++ as both a commandline program or with a Qt GUI. At the time I started I didn't know anything about Cryptography and little did I know I would become involved so heavily in Crypto/CompSec. So it's nice to see the roots of what started off as a simple hobby and is now a career path.
